### Target Audience

The right mental model of how a tool is working turns "Why did it do *that*?" into "I bet this will fix my problem."

This course is for people who know some of the git commands, but find them mysterious, magical, or error prone.

When you're done, you should feel fearless about exploring the entire world of git.
