### Branches and Tags are Post-it Notes
#### Branches and tags are entirely local.
- Tags look like branches, yet there's a difference
  - They're both sticky notes
    - show `git tag`/`git branch`, `git tag -d`/`git branch -d`, `git push origin :<branchname>`, `git push origin :<tagname>`
    - show `.git/refs/` as we make branches and tags
  - Look around you. Wherever you are, that's `HEAD`
    - show `cat .git/HEAD`
    - show `git status` and `HEAD` after a branch checkout and a tag checkout
  - Branches and tags *name* SHA1s
    - show `git rev-parse`
    - show `git describe`
    - discuss `<commit-ish>`
  - Remotes are just names, too 
    - show `git remote -v`
    - show `.git/refs/heads/remotes` and `git remote add`
    - show `git fetch`
    - show `git push`
  - But how do they differ?
    - show changing branches
    - show trying to change tags
    - show actually changing tags
    - show trying to change remotes
    - show actually changing remotes
- The <commit-ish> makes it easier to think about merges, diffs, rebases, fetches
    - show some of these and talk through the process
- "You can observe a lot by watching"
  - show `gitg/gitk` on a tree as we branch, tag, merge
  - show graphical demos on the web
  - show GitHub graphs of branches, tags
