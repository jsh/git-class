### Branches and Tags are Post-it Notes
#### Branches and tags are entirely local.
- Tags look like branches, yet there's a difference
  - They're both sticky notes
    - show `gitg/gitk` on a tree with branches and tags
    - make a new commit and a new tag and refresh `gitg`
  - Look around you. Wherever you are, that's `HEAD`
    - show `cat .git/HEAD`
    -  
    - show `git status` and `HEAD` after a branch checkout and a tag checkout
  - Branches and tags *name* SHA1s
    - show `git rev-parse`
    - show `git describe`
    - discuss `<commit-ish>`
  - Remotes are just names, too 
    - show `git remote -v`
    - show `.git/refs/heads/remotes` and `git remote add`
    - show `git fetch`
    - show `git push`
  - But how do they differ?
    - show changing branches
    - show trying to change tags
    - show actually changing tags
    - show trying to change remotes
    - show actually changing remotes
- The <commit-ish> makes it easier to think about merges, diffs, rebases, fetches
    - show some of these and talk through the process
- Review: "You can observe a lot by watching"
  - note: `.git/refs` holds names of <commit-ish>s -- analogous, in ways, to the directory in Linux
  - note: names for branches move as we commit, names for tags don't
  - note: Names for remotes move when we fetch and push
  - note: graphical tools, like `gitg/gitk`, can help you visualize
  - show graphical demos on the web
