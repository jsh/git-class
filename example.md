A bunch of text
that's gathered into a paragraph.

A second paragraph.

- here's a bullet-list item

       $ here's some code
       $ here's what it does
       $ here's some more
And a comment joined to the code block.

- here's a second item in the list

      together with some code in the item.

And now we're back to the main article
and its indentation level.
