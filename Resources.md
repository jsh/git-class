Gerrit
----

Here is where you can get [Google's gerrit code-review and access-management tool](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/)

Luca Milanesio's book, [Learning Gerrit Code Review](www.amazon.com/Learning-Gerrit-Code-Review-Milanesio/dp/1783289473), doesn't contain a lot of technical details, but has good, basic instructions on installing and using the tool.

Git Annex
-------

The [git annex command](https://git-annex.branchable.com) extends git to handle binaries.

Git Books
-----

[ Scott Chacon's ProGit Book ](http://git-scm.com/book) is comprehensive and well-written.


Git Flow
-------

[Vincent Driessen's git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) is a popular work-flow model and tool. It's now a standard package for both Ubuntu and Fedora.
Git Internals Visualization Tools
----------

- [The git-achievements package](https://github.com/icefox/git-achievements) installs a game that monitors your git-learning progress.

- Wei Wang's [Explain Git with D3](http://www.wei-wang.com/ExplainGitWithD3/)
is a beautifully-done visualization tool.

- Another tool along the same lines, which adds some game elements, is [Learn Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/)

- [Git Pretty](http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/) is a flowchart of how you can dig yourself out of git problems. It's funny *and* accurate.

Repo
------

- [Google's repo command](https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/) is a useful, abysmally documented tool for managing projects that are build from multiple git repositories.

- A useful annex to the Google documentation is [XDA University's Repo Tips & Tricks](http://xda-university.com/as-a-developer/repo-tips-tricks).
