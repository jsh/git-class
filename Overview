Overview
=========

File Format
-------

Files with the suffix ".md" are textfiles formatted with GitHub-flavored markdown.
This repo is on GitHub, and Markdown is unobtrusive enough that I can get a fair amount of bang-for-the-buck by using it. They should format nicely on GitHub, without making them hard to read or manipulate as text.

Directory contents
------

`Puzzles` has material for self-study.
`Answers` has sample answers.
The puzzles aren't meant to be hard or tedious, just thought-provoking.
I suggest working through them before looking at my "answers," because your solution will probably be as good as mine, and it'll give you a chance to contrast the two.

Prezi
--------

This repo accompanies a Prezi-based presentation. The URL of the presentation is in the `Prezi` file.
