When you type a git commands, like "git show" what happens?
The git command itself, invokes the git-subcommand, "git-show" .
Git subcommands are typically installed in their own directory, which isn't in your $PATH, but the git command itself knows about.

- Where are the git subcommands installed?
- How many are there?
- How does that compare to the number of commands in each subdirectory in your $PATH?
