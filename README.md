git-class
=========

An intermediate git class.

I use git on the command line. It's a power tool for developers, built by Linus Torvalds to manage the Linux kernel.
When I give commands or paths, it's as a Linux user, doing things from a terminal window.

I'm running Ubunu 14.04 (LTS) right now

Aside from installing packages when I discover I need them, I leave my distro fairly stock,
so I don't have to re-customize every time I re-install: bash, gnome, unity.

I take updates frequently.

I upgrade to a new LTS every two years, when it comes out. Sometimes, I have to learn how to do old things in new ways.
I treat this as a feature, not a bug.

If you work differently, or run some other Linux flavor, details may differ,
but you won't have much trouble translating on the fly.

If you work with git through a gui tool or an IDE, or run it on Windows or a Mac, YMMV.

I'm saying this once, at the outset, to keep from having to say it all over the place as I go along.
