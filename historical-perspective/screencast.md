### SCM History Helps it Make Sense
#### What came before?
- A brief history by decade
  - show `rcs`
  - note: Marc J. Rochkind wrote SCCS in 1972.
  - note: RCS came in the mid-80's, CVS in the mid-90's, DVCS in the mid-naughties.
  - note: each is tailored to the hardware and software environments of its time
  - note: each has flaws that give birth to its successor
- What `git` gets you. Use cases for DVCS:
  - note: four use cases
    - removing the Linux-development bottleneck
    - flying to Bucharest or Tokyo
    - collaborating at a conference or coffee shop
    - personal branches and tags
  - show: example of `svn` vs. `git` speed
- The hard problems: diffing and merging
  - show: `git diff`, `git merge`, `git rebase`
  - note: there are other DVCS tools: mercurial, bitkeeper, arch, bazaar, darcs, svk, ... 
#### What's here now?
- Successful tools create their own ecosystem. Some examples
  - CVSDude -> CollabNet
    - show Collabnet
  - GitHub: if it's a DVCS, what's the point?
    - show: GitHub
    - show: `git clone` from GitHub
    - note: a central synchronization point is not a bottleneck
    - show: sample exercises on GitHub
    - note: a central synchronization point permits maintained cloud storage with extra sauce
    - note: a central synchronization point lets you publish source to yourself and others
  - GitHub Services
    - note: GitHub itself is a service that breeds an ecosystem
    - show: DockerHub
    - show: list of services
    - note: GitHub's `hub` command
    - note: there are alternatives to GitHub -- bitbucket, GitLab, Atalassian Stash
  - `git`'s simple design makes it easy to build commands on top of it.
    - show: `gitg` again
    - show: `.gitconfig` and `git lol`
    - show: `git-scratch`
#### What might be coming -- filling the gaps?
- _Quo vadis?_ What are folks groping toward?
  - What's missing? (What have folks built?)
    - show: `apt-cache search git`
    - Workflow
      - show: `git-flow`, `/usr/lib/git-core` and how `/usr/bin/git` work
      - show: aliases in `.git/config`
      - note: there is no `git alias`, no `git function definition`
      - mention GitHub workflow and Code School's **Mastering GitHub** video
    - Handling multiple repos.
      - show: `git submodule`
      - note: `git subtree`
      - show: Google's `repo`
      - note: there is no consensus
    - Access control
      - show: `gitolite`
      - show: `gerrit`
      - note: `gitorious`, `gitosis` came before, what comes after?
  - It's up to you, isn't it?
#### Review
- History tells us how we got here and why.
- Each generation focuses on the mistakes of its parents.
- Git is a DVCS
- `git-core` is missing things that people are supplying
- as I give this, it's nearly 2015
