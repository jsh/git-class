Games and Other Teaching Tools

Several sites I like give you good ways to visualize git. Some are sillier than others, but even the more serious-minded are useful.

* [Wei-Wang's *Explain Git with D3* animates the basic git operations.](http://www.wei-wang.com/ExplainGitWithD3/)
* [Justin Hileman's *Git Pretty* walks through how to dig yourself out of a hole.](http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/)
* [Icefox's *Git Achievements* is a badge-earning game](https://github.com/icefox/git-achievements), and so is [Gazler's Githug](https://github.com/Gazler/githug).
* [Neo's *Git Immersion*](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a step-by-step walkthrough in text mode.
* [Code-School's *Try Git*](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) is an animated, graphics-oriented walkthrough. 
(I also recommend their *Git Real* courses. They're not free, but they're inexpensive.)
* [Nick Quaranto's *Git Ready* feeds you bite-sized lessons on `git`, organized by level: beginner, intermediate, and advanced](http://gitready.com/)
