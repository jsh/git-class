## Git's Design Makes Sense

###To Understand Git, Think Like Linus
#### Git is a content-addressable filesystem. Why?
### You Just Need to Know Three Kinds of Things (Okay, four.)
#### Objects have four flavors. Gotta have three.
### SCM History Helps it Make Sense
#### What came before? What's coming next?
### Branches and Tags are Post-it Notes
#### Annotated tags are the fourth object type.
### Review: How's this perspective help?
#### Think History. Think Linus. Think "How would I do this?" Think "What's in it for me?"
