When you type a git commands, like "git show" what happens?
The git command itself, invokes the git-subcommand, "git-show" .
Git subcommands are typically installed in their own directory, which isn't in your $PATH, but the git command itself knows about.

(Answers below are for my Ubuntu 14.04 laptop, right now. YMMV.)

- Where are the git subcommands installed?
/usr/lib/git-core

- How many are there?
167

- How does that compare to the number of commands in each subdirectory in your $PATH?

  $ for i in ${PATH//:/ }; do printf "$i: "; ls $i | wc -l; done
  /home/jhaemer/bin: 9
  /usr/local/sbin: 2
  /usr/local/bin: 9
  /usr/sbin: 267
  /usr/bin: 2729
  /sbin: 250
  /bin: 152
  /usr/games: 5

A dramatic reading of that command:

  $ echo $PATH                                                    # this is your path
  $ echo ${PATH//:/ }                                             # this is your path on spaces
  $ for i in ${PATH://: }; do echo $i; done                       # process one path directory at a time
  $ for i in ${PATH://: }; do echo $i; ls $i | wc -l; done        # count entries in each dir
  $ for i in ${PATH://: }; do printf "$i: "; ls $i | wc -l; done  # beauty is truth, truth beauty
