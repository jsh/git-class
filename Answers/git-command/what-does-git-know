What's git know about?

The git command is just a front end.

Let's build a one-liner to show what it knows about.

  $ which git                       # tells you where git is
  $ file $(which git)               # tells you it's a binary
  $ strings $(which git)            # tells you what printable strings are in the binary
  $ strings $(which git) | grep ^/  # which printable strings might be absolute paths
  $ for i in $(strings $(which git) | grep ^/); do [ -e $i ] && echo $i; done
                                    # which strings actually are absolute paths

- What is each one?
On Ubuntu 14.04

  $ file $(for i in $(strings $(which git) | grep ^/); do [ -e $i ] && echo $i; done)

  /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: symbolic link to `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.19.so' 
  /bin/sh:                     symbolic link to `bash' 
  /usr:                        directory 
  /usr/lib/git-core:           directory 
  /usr/share/locale:           directory 
  /tmp:                        sticky, directory 
  /dev/tty:                    character special 

- Why does git know about them?

Most of those are basic Linux. (Make friends with Google and man(1).) /usr/lib/git-core/ is where all the git sub-commands are installed.
