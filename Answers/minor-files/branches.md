Don't Worry about `.git/branches`
=================================

`.git/branches` is "semi-deprecated".
You can do stuff with it that will still work.
You'll think it's very clever.
Six months later, you won't remember how it works or why you did it.
Some day, when it's not supported at all,
you only won't remember why you did it.

If you want to spend your time playing with it, do.
How you spend your time is your business, not mine.
